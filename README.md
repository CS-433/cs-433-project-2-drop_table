The original repositery for the LCD network can be found [here](https://github.com/hkust-vgd/lcd).

It corresponds to the lcd-base source code.

We also have a modified version that uses pytorch-lightning to exploit multiple nodes on a cluster.

The bash scripts used to train the networks are in the "run scripts" folder.

To choose which version to train, simply rename the directory containing the source code to lcd and the corresponding training script as "train.py".
